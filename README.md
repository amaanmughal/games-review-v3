# Games Review Website V3

This is a re-imagined version of my original games review website with increased functionality.

# How to use

Upon opening the website you will be greeted with the home landing page which will show all the reviews created. From here you will have several options. You can filter the reviews by category, sort the reviews through a number of parameters and order them ascending or descending. You can click any of the review and they will take you to another page where you can see a break down of the individual review and the comments associated. You can also click on the users link in the nav where you can login as an existing user or create a new user.

# User page

Once clicked you will be redirected to the user page where you can choose whether to login or create a new user. Login inputs required are the username and full name. Once logged in you will be shown a card with the user profile pic, username and name. Three will also be a button on the bottom of the card for the user to logout. An account will be needed to post a comment on a review.

# Review page

On an individual review, you can leave a comment as long as you are logged in. You can also delete the comment using the delete button if you wish.
